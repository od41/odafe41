                <p>I like to figure out how things are made, and sometimes make things myself.
                Slightly scatterbrained and comfortable with ambiguity, I enjoy discovering what makes things tick. I’ve built a diagnostic system, managed an editorial, published a magazine, led a group of community service volunteers, played amateur basketball, recited poetry, designed logos, built websites and written the occasional short story.
That said when asked, “what do you do?” I say “I’m a designer.” That’s it.</p>
